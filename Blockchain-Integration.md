# Blockchain Integration Guide: Adding Blockchain Features Using ThirdWeb

This guide provides references to ThirdWeb documentation for integrating blockchain features into your game using Unity or Unreal Engine on the Avalanche Fuji testnet.

> Remember: Focus on creating a seamless user experience first, then build complexity as needed. The best blockchain games are those where users don't need to understand blockchain to enjoy the game.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment
ThirdWeb provides pre-built, audited contracts deployable via:  
- [Dashboard](https://portal.thirdweb.com/pre-built-contracts/tokens)  
- Programmatic deployment  

Supports ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and customization.

### 2. Wallet Integration
[Wallet FAQ](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallet) covers:  
- EVM compatibility  
- Multiple authentication methods  
- Recovery options  
- Gasless transactions  
- Account abstraction  

### 3. Game Engine Integration

**Unreal Engine** ([docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unreal-engine))  
- In-App Wallets with email/social login  
- Account abstraction + session keys  
- UE 5.3â€“5.5 support  

**Unity** ([docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/v5))  
- Wallet integration  
- Smart contract interactions  
- Asset management  
- Transactions  

### 4. Advanced Features
- [Account Abstraction](https://portal.thirdweb.com/wallet/smart-wallet)  
- Sign In with Ethereum  
- Gas Sponsorship  
- Payment Options  

## Best Practices
- **Security:** wallet guidelines, secure sessions  
- **UX:** pre-built UI, error handling, platform-native flow  
- **Performance:** caching, transaction optimization
